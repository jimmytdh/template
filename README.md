## TDH Template
The official template used by TDH for the developed systems.

## Installation

This template requires [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install some of the packages needed for the template.

Open bash in your project directory and enter the following command:
```bash
cd /your/directory/template
npm install
mkdir vendor
```
To edit the template, just open the ``scss`` folder and update the specific item that you want to edit.

After editing, enter the following command to terminal:
```bash
sass scss/bootstrap:css/bootstrap.css
```
Copy the required **packages** from ``node_modules`` folder to ``vendor`` folder.
